# User Profile System Setup Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive user profile system for IntraExtra with the following features:

### 1. Database Schema
- **user_profiles** - Extended user information beyond Supabase auth.users
- **user_roles** - Role management system (Master, Senior, Mid, External, HR)
- **user_preferences** - User interface and notification preferences  
- **user_sessions** - Session tracking for analytics

### 2. User Service (userService.ts)
- Complete user profile management
- Role assignment and permission checking
- Profile updates and avatar management
- Authentication integration

### 3. Updated Components
- **Header** - Now displays real user data and role information
- **HomeDashboard** - Shows authentic user profile information
- **LoginPage** - Enhanced signup form with name, job title, and department
- **UserProfilePage** - Integrated with real data (existing component)
- **RoleManagement** - New admin interface for Master users

### 4. Authentication Flow
- Automatic profile creation on user signup
- Profile data passed through metadata
- Default role assignment (External)
- Trigger-based profile management

## 🔧 Manual Setup Required

Since local Docker/Supabase isn't available, you need to manually apply the migration:

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire content of: `supabase/migrations/20250905_create_user_profiles.sql`
3. Execute the SQL to create all tables, triggers, and functions

### Step 2: Setup Master User
1. After migration, log into the application with `tyson@casfid.com`
2. Go to Settings → Role Management (will appear for Master users)
3. Click "Setup Master User" to assign yourself Master permissions

### Step 3: Test Multi-User Setup
1. Create a test user account with different email
2. Log in with the test account to verify profile creation
3. Switch back to tyson@casfid.com to manage the test user's role

All components now use real authentication data instead of hardcoded values.

## 📝 Next Steps

After manual setup:
1. All users will see their real profile data
2. Master users can manage roles through the UI
3. New signups automatically create complete profiles
4. Role-based permissions control access levels
5. Session tracking provides user analytics
